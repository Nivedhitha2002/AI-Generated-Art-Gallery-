Created a simple website using HTML, CSS and Javascript involves integrating the OPENAI API to create or generate art dynamically.
To generate AI images I'm using my own API key in the OPENAI_API_KEY variable. So to get a free API key from OpenAI, sign up for an account at https://platform.openai/account/api-keys.
